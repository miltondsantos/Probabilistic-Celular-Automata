Probabilistic Cellular Automata

This task was given by Professor Dr. Jose Ricardo Gonçalves de Mendonça on Complex System Simulation I, program of Complex System Modeling MSc. at USP.

The problem is calculate the alpha value, i.e., the probability that any noise happens for given Wolfram rule (1d).

These scripts are the first step to check the transformation from rule in (before noise) to rule out (after noise).
