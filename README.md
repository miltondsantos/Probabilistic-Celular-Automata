Probabilistic Cellular Automata

This issue was explained for me by Professor Jose Ricardo Gonçalves de Mendonça on Complex System Simulation I, program Complex System Modeling MSc. at USP.

The problem is calculate the alpha value, i.e., probability that any noise happens in the Wolfram rule (1d).

These scripts are the first step to check the transformation from rule in (before noise) to rule out (after noise).
